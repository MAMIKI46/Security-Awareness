# Security Awareness — Quick Reference (One Page)

Purpose: Short, practical reminders to help staff reduce common security risks.

1. Phishing & Suspicious Messages
- Pause before you click links or open attachments. Verify unexpected requests by phone or separate channel.
- Check sender addresses carefully; look for typos or impersonation.
- When in doubt, do not reply — report to IT/security.

2. Passwords & Accounts
- Use a password manager to create and store unique, strong passwords.
- Avoid reusing passwords across services.
- Change passwords only if notified by IT or suspect compromise.

3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enable MFA on all accounts that support it (work and personal).
- Prefer authenticator apps or hardware keys over SMS where possible.

4. Device Security
- Lock devices when unattended; use screen lock PIN/password/biometrics.
- Keep OS and applications up to date — install security updates promptly.
- Avoid installing unapproved software or plugins.

5. Network Safety
- Use corporate VPN for remote access to internal systems.
- Avoid public Wi‑Fi for sensitive transactions; use a hotspot or VPN if needed.
- Verify Wi‑Fi names before connecting.

6. Data Handling & Privacy
- Follow the principle of least privilege: only access and share data needed for your role.
- Store sensitive data in approved systems and encrypt when required.
- Remove sensitive data from local drives when no longer needed.

7. Removable Media & Physical Security
- Don’t plug in unknown USB devices.
- Keep laptops and sensitive documents secured; report lost/stolen devices immediately.

8. Reporting Incidents
- Report suspected phishing, data leaks, or device loss immediately to the security/IT team.
- Include screenshots, email headers, or timelines if available.
- Prompt reporting reduces impact.

9. Social Engineering Awareness
- Be skeptical of urgent requests for money, credentials, or secrets — verify identity first.
- Don’t share credentials with co‑workers or vendors by email.

10. Personal Best Practices
- Separate personal and work accounts where possible.
- Regularly review account permissions and authorized apps.
- Participate in periodic security training and simulated phishing exercises.
